## Project Overview

The Rule-Based System for Tourism is a web application developed to assist with various tourism-related needs. The project was implemented as a collaborative effort among four team members.

Utilizing **Spring Boot** on the backend, in conjunction with **Drools** for the rule-based decision-making process, and **Angular** for the frontend, this system provides a robust solution for managing tourism-related decisions.

## Key Features

- **Decision Making:** Implemented a rule-based decision-making system using **Drools**, where rules are defined in _.drl_ files to determine various actions and outcomes.
- **User Authentication:** Integrated **Spring Security** for secure user authentication and access control.
- **Data Management:** Utilized **JPA** (Java Persistence API) for effective data management and persistence.

## Benefits

This project was my first experience with a rule-based system tool. Working with Drools allowed me to deepen my understanding of decision-making processes in software applications and how to implement business rules effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java)
- **Frontend:** Angular
- **Decision Engine:** Drools
- **Security:** Spring Security
- **ORM:** JPA (Java Persistence API)

## Lessons Learned

- Gained hands-on experience with Drools and its application in rule-based systems.
- Developed a deeper understanding of Spring Boot and its integration with other technologies.
- Enhanced skills in implementing Spring Security for user authentication.
