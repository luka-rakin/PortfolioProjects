# Tourism App - Modular Monolith

This project is a web application built as a modular monolith using .NET for the backend and Angular for the frontend. The primary purpose of the application is to serve the tourism industry by providing a platform where tour authors can create custom tours with key points of interest, challenges, and competitions for users. Users, in turn, can purchase these tours and use the app as a virtual tour guide while exploring on their own, without the need for a physical tour guide.

## Key Features

- **Tour Creation:** Authors can design unique tours, complete with essential points to visit and challenges for users to engage with during their tour.
- **User Participation:** Users can purchase and complete tours at their own pace, with the app acting as a virtual guide.
- **Engaging Challenges:** Tours include optional challenges and competitions, enhancing the user experience with fun and interactive elements.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** .NET (Modular Monolith Architecture)
- **Frontend:** Angular (Separate frontend application)
- **Agile Methodologies:** Scrum framework with sprints, daily stand-ups, and Trello for task management.

## Development Process

This project was particularly valuable because of its collaborative nature. A team of 15 members worked together to deliver a high-quality application while practicing key principles of teamwork, problem-solving, and professional communication. Here are some key aspects of the development process:

- Teamwork and Scrum:

  - The project followed **Scrum**, an agile development methodology, where work was divided into sprints.
  - **Daily meetings** were held to track progress, address roadblocks, and adjust priorities.
  - Each sprint had a designated **Scrum Master**, and we used **Trello** to organize tasks and manage our workflow. - At the end of each sprint, we conducted a **sprint review**, analyzing what went well, what could be improved, and what we learned as a team.

- Stakeholder Communication:

  - Although the projectâ€™s theme was predefined, specific features were developed in consultation with real-world **domain experts**, including local tour guides, tourists, and representatives from travel agencies.
  - These stakeholders provided valuable input on what features would be most beneficial for the app, and we adapted our development process accordingly.

- Learning Objectives:

  - The most significant learning outcome of this project was not merely the coding and technical challenges but the **teamwork** and **communication** required to succeed in a large team.
  - We learned how to **support and praise team members** when they performed well and how to provide **constructive criticism** when needed.
  - Effective **communication with stakeholders** was also a key part of the project, where we had to balance feature requests with technical feasibility and deliver a product that met user needs.

## Code availability

Unfortunately, I am unable to share the codebase for this project as it resides in a private repository, and I do not have the ability to make it public. However, the greatest value of this project lies not just in the implementation, but in the **teamwork**, **stakeholder engagement**, and **processes** that made the project successful.
