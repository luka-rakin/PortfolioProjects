# Medicines Distribution System

[View the Repository Here](https://github.com/orgs/ISA-tim-57/repositories)

## Project Overview

The Medicines Distribution System is a web application designed for the distribution and sale of medicines to pharmacies and medical institutions. The system primarily handles transactions with legal entities, enabling the smooth sale and distribution of medical products.

This project was developed as part of the course Internet Software Architectures, which I later chose as the foundation for my graduate thesis.
Initially, the project was planned to be developed by a team of four members. However, due to some challenges, I ended up working alone by the end of the course, completing my assigned tasks and a bit more to finish the project and pass the course. Later, one more team member completed his part, but the others have not, for now.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java)
- **Frontend:** Angular
- **ORM:** JPA (Java Persistence API)
- **Security:** Spring Security
- **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ (basic understanding)
- **Maps:** Leaflet (for location simulation)

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with the **Spring Boot** framework and implemented key features like **Spring Security** for user authentication and authorization. I also briefly worked with **RabbitMQ**, learning how message brokers function in distributed systems. Additionally, I implemented a simple location simulator using **Leaflet maps**, which was one of the project requirements.

## Key Features

- Manage medicine distribution to pharmacies and medical institutions.
- Handle transactions with legal entities.
- Implemented secure user authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
- Integrated Spring Boot's powerful features with JPA for ORM.
- Basic introduction to message-driven systems using RabbitMQ.
- Simulated real-world locations with Leaflet maps for distribution purposes.

## Lessons Learned

- Extensive knowledge of the **Spring Boot** framework and its ecosystem.
- Implemented **Spring Security** for secure access control.
- Practical exposure to using **RabbitMQ** as a message broker, though at an introductory level.
- Gained hands-on experience with **Leaflet maps** to simulate locations as part of the distribution process.
